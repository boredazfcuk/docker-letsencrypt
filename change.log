 - Change: Added leading zero to any single digit minute randomly generated for crontab time
 - Change: Healthcheck command 'certbot certificates' does an OSCP check against ocsp.int-x3.letsencrypt.org for certificate revocation. Certificate revocation status is only updated twice a day from what I understand. Healthcheck now exits out if a previous check was performed that day. This prevents spamming the LE server.

 - Change: Forgot to update crontab file to run entrypoint.sh instead of update-certificates.sh
 - Change: Logic for renewing multiple domains wasn't correct. Altered to remove the -d option from 'certbot renew'. 
 - Change: Certbot was using the 'renew' option, which renews all certificates on a system. This introduces a problem in a multi-cert environment (Nextcloud) as it chucks an error if all certs haven't exipred. I've changed this to the 'certonly' renewal method and loop through each domain so they are renewed individually.

 - Change: Now using ENTRYPOINT launch methond instead of CMD
 - Change: Use exec to launch crontab so process inherits PID from parent
